		<title>Introduction</title>

		<para>A context is an object that can be passed between tiers of an application without exposing the APIs that are particular to any given tier. For example, in a web application the information submitted by a user in an HttpRequest object could be exposed to a business object through the Context interface. This leaves objects in the business tier independent of the servlet API and thus testable outside a Servlet container.  <emphasis>This chapter has yet to be written</emphasis></para>
