/**
 * <p>
 * An object that can convert one type of object into another type of object.
 * Usually, the sourceClasses and destinationClasses attributes determine the
 * set of sources and destinations which the converter can convert.  However,
 * if any of the sourceClasses is not convertible to a destinationClass, then
 * a converter may implement the {@link net.sf.morph.transform.ExplicitTransformer}
 * to explicitly define which sources are convertible to which destinations.
 * </p>
 *  
 * <p>
 * Note that the Converter interface can be easily implemented by a Copier (see
 * {@link net.sf.morph.transform.converters.CopierConverter}), so it is
 * recommended that Converters only be implemented for basic data types
 * (numbers, primitives) or immutable data types (e.g. Strings, but note Dates).
