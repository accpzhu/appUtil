/**
 * <p>
 * An extension of the Converter interface that defines a few more convenient
 * methods. All methods specified in this interface can be easily implemented
 * using just the methods in the Converter interface. Thus, if you are defining
 * your own converter you should implement only the Converter interface. If you
 * extend from {@link net.sf.morph.transform.converters.BaseConverter}, your
 * converter will implement this inteface automatically. If you don't want to
 * extend from <code>BaseConverter</code>, you can still easily expose this
 * interface by using the
 * {@link net.sf.morph.transform.converters.ConverterDecorator}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em>You should not directly implement this interface, because additional
 * methods may be introduced in later versions of Morph.  Instead, implement the
 * Converter interface and use the ConverterDecorator to expose this
 * interface.</em>
