/**
 * <p>
 * An extension of the Transformer interface that defines extra methods. All
 * methods specified in this interface can be easily implemented using just the
 * methods in the Transformer interface. Thus, if you are defining your own
 * transformer you should implement only the Transformer interface. If you
 * extend from {@link net.sf.morph.transform.transformers.BaseTransformer},
 * your transformer will implement this interface automatically.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you don't want to extend from <code>BaseTransformer</code>, you can
 * still easily expose this interface by using the
 * {@link net.sf.morph.transform.transformer.TransformerDecorator}.
