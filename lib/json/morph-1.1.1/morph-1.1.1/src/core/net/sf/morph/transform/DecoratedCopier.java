/**
 * <p>
 * An extension of the Copier interface that defines a few more convenient
 * methods. All methods specified in this interface can be easily implemented
 * using just the methods in the Copier interface. Thus, if you are defining
 * your own copier you should implement the only Copier interface. If you extend
 * from {@link net.sf.morph.transform.converters.BaseCopier}, your copier will
 * implement this inteface automatically. If you don't want to extend from
 * <code>BaseCopier</code>, you can easily expose this interface by using the
 * {@link net.sf.morph.transform.copiers.CopierDecorator}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <em>You should not directly implement this interface, because additional
 * methods may be introduced in later versions of Morph.  Instead, implement the
 * Copier interface and use the CopierDecorator to expose this interface.</em>
