        <p><a href="/images/morphed_scoreboard_large.png"><img src="/images/morphed_scoreboard_small.png" border="0"/></a> Scoreboard is a web-based J2EE corporate performance management tool used for measuring performance and communicating strategy across the entire employee-base. The web application includes an administration applet for creating and updating corporate strategy maps, allowing an administrator to drag-and-drop strategic objective elements from the corporate hierarchy on to a visual map. The typical non-administrator user views the resulting strategy map as a dynamic image on an HTML page, complete with live data-driven color status indicators and image-mapped drill-down links.  <a href="http://www.spiderstrategies.com">Website</a></p>
